To all employees of PT. A B C D,

Best wishes,

In order to celebrate Christmas and New Year, our company will provide holidays on 24-25 December 2023 and 31 December 2023 to 1 January 2024.

We hope that employees can take advantage of this holiday time to be with family and loved ones, and take time to rest and reflect on the past year.

We remind you again that this year-end holiday is included in the employee's annual leave. For employees who have not fulfilled their annual leave allotment, salary reductions will be made in accordance with applicable regulations.

The hope is that employees can take their leave wisely and can return with a fresh spirit to start the new year with gusto.

Thank you for your attention and have a nice year-end holiday.

Best regards,

[Name of Company Leader]
